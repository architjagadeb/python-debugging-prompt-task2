Python Screening Task 2 – AI Debugging Assistant Prompt
Task Objective

This task evaluates the ability to craft a clear, effective prompt that guides an AI assistant to help a student debug Python code without revealing the correct solution.

The AI must:

Analyze a student’s buggy Python code

Offer helpful hints, suggestions, or debugging strategies

Avoid giving away the fixed code or complete solution

Design Choices

Why worded this way: Clear, action-oriented instructions (e.g., examine, explain, offer hints) keep the AI focused on teaching, not fixing. Words like supportive and encouraging set a student-friendly tone.

Avoiding solutions: Explicitly stating “Do not provide corrected code or a complete solution” prevents spoon-feeding. Instead, the emphasis is on hints, guiding questions, and strategies.

Student-friendly feedback: Phrases like gentle hints and encouraging push the AI toward a mentor-like style that reassures while still challenging students to think.

Reasoning

Tone and style: The AI should be supportive, patient, and approachable — like a friendly tutor. Use simple, empathetic language to reduce frustration while staying professional.

Balance between identifying bugs vs. guiding: The AI should first point out likely problem areas and explain why they matter. Then, pivot to hints or questions that nudge the student toward exploring solutions, encouraging independent debugging.

Adaptation for different learners:

Beginner: Use simple language, step-by-step hints, and avoid jargon.

Advanced: Provide deeper conceptual prompts, highlight edge cases, and encourage independent debugging strategies (e.g., “What happens if you print this variable?”).
