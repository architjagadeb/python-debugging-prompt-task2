# Python Screening Task 2 – AI Debugging Assistant  

## 1. Task Objective  
This task evaluates the ability to craft a clear, effective prompt that guides an AI assistant to help a student debug Python code **without revealing the correct solution**.  

The AI must:  
- Analyze a student’s buggy Python code  
- Offer helpful hints, suggestions, or debugging strategies  
- Avoid giving away the fixed code or complete solution  

---

## 2. Design Choices  

### a) Why worded this way  
- Used **clear, action-oriented instructions** (*examine, explain, offer hints*) to keep the AI focused on teaching, not fixing.  
- Chose words like **supportive** and **encouraging** to set a student-friendly tone.  

### b) Avoiding solutions  
- Explicitly stated: *“Do not provide corrected code or a complete solution.”*  
- Encourages **guiding questions and hints** instead of spoon-feeding answers.  

### c) Student-friendly feedback  
- Added phrases like *gentle hints* and *encouraging* to push the AI toward a **mentor-like role**, offering reassurance while challenging students to think.

## 3. Reasoning  

### a) Tone and Style  
- Should be **supportive, patient, and approachable** — like a friendly tutor.  
- Use simple, empathetic language to reduce frustration while staying professional.  

### b) Balance: Identifying Bugs vs. Guiding  
1. **Step 1:** Point out likely problem areas.  
2. **Step 2:** Explain why those issues matter.  
3. **Step 3:** Provide hints or questions that nudge students toward the fix.  

### c) Adaptation for Learners  
- **Beginners:**  
  - Use simple language, break down steps clearly, and avoid jargon.  
  - Provide direct but non-revealing hints.  

- **Advanced Learners:**  
  - Highlight deeper **conceptual errors** and edge cases.  
  - Encourage debugging strategies (e.g., *“What happens if you print this variable?”*).
